# snake-game
This is a basic snake game for me to get familiar with Python and general software development practices such as version control, testing, development cycle, refactoring, etc...

Runs on Python 3

The game is playable.
Opposite direction allowed when you are 1 cell long. You can't go backwards when
you are more than one cell long.
Open by running "python snake_game.py" in cmd.

TO-DO on next release:
    Unit testing is currently 30% done. Finish unit testing. Unit testing is not finished in this release because
    the model, view and controller are tricky to test and that I'm lazy.

    Add exceptions if I have time interest to do so.
